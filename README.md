# AI-Agriculture-Capstone-Project
Repository for AI Capstone Project, teaching farmers how to effectively use Machine Learning and AI

Current Status:
Code has been reconnected and successfully ran in flask, and the source of the images and their metadata has been found.

Next Steps:
Creating our own image dataset and repository for the drone images, processing those images into a new CSV file, and disconnecting the old CSV file from the network. Reverse engineering and editing the ImagePreprocessing, DataPreproccesing and ML_Class to successfully train a network on said dataset and get high correct confidence.
