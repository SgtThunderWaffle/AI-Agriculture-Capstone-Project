         STEP 5: Testing the Model
    </div>

    <div class="description">

     <div class="content-box">
	Testing the model is presenting data from the original dataset, but excluded from the training set, to see if it can properly conclude what it is based on the data it already has. This can help show weaknesses or exploits that the model has.<br> 
	Examples of exploits being: every image of a particular category had a red pixel in 1 spot and so the AI will always say something with that red pixel is in that category.<br>
	Testing is best used to see when you need to redo the training algorithm, or even if there are issues with the training dataset itself. It is very helpful for detecting problems before deployment
