	This section is where most coding and technical knowledge is applied, for our purposes information will be displayed in general terms
	<ul>
		<li>Training is typically done in batches of images, rather than the whole set at once, which are called epochs. Epochs are not a defined unit of time, but are a good measurement of how long training may take.</li>
		<li>Training takes processed data as the code that makes the determination of what category it thinks the input belongs in canâ€™t directly see an image or watch a video or hear music and looks at datapoints to identify features.</li>
		<li>The final score of what category the data input fits into is decided by weighting many neurons, this score is called a confidence level and typically given in a percentage.</li>
