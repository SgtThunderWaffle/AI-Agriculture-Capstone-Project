	Differences between Training and testing and why they should be separate:
	<ul>
		<li>If the same dataset is used for training and testing, the model tends to learn what images are in each set and simply memorize the answers leading to poor performance with new data</li>
		<li>Training data is best used to give it all the skills you want, testing data is to ensure that the training was successful, using the same data for both is not productive in this aim</li>
		<li>Testing data can include traits the AI hasnâ€™t been trained on yet, to see if it can still achieve the desired result before integrating the new feature into the training dataset</li>
